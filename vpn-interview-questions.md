### **1. What is a VPN?**

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. It encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, masking your real IP address and location.

### **2. How does a VPN protect privacy?**

A VPN protects privacy by:

* **Encrypting data** so that ISPs, hackers, or governments can’t see what you're doing.
* **Hiding your IP address** to prevent websites from tracking your real location.
* Preventing tracking over public Wi-Fi networks.

### **3. Difference between VPN and Proxy?**

| Feature    | VPN                          | Proxy                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Encryption | Yes (encrypts all traffic)   | No encryption             |
| Speed      | Slightly slower              | Generally faster          |
| Scope      | System-wide (entire device)  | App/browser-level only    |
| Privacy    | High                         | Low                       |
| Use Case   | Privacy, security, streaming | Bypassing geo-blocks only |

### **4. What is encryption in VPN?**

Encryption in VPN is the process of converting your readable internet data into **scrambled, unreadable form** using algorithms like **AES-256**. Only the VPN server can decrypt it, ensuring secure communication even over public networks.

---

### **5. Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?**

**No.** While a VPN significantly enhances privacy, it doesn’t provide **complete anonymity**.

* Your VPN provider could technically log your data.
* Websites can still track you via cookies, browser fingerprinting, or logged-in accounts (like Google).
* For stronger anonymity, tools like **Tor** are better.

---

### **6. What protocols do VPNs use?**

VPNs use various **tunneling protocols** to manage security and speed:

* **OpenVPN** – Very secure, open-source, widely used
* **WireGuard** – Newer, faster, and efficient
* **IKEv2/IPSec** – Good for mobile stability
* **L2TP/IPSec** – Older, less efficient
* **PPTP** – Deprecated due to weak security

---

### **7. What are some VPN limitations?**

* **Slower speeds** due to encryption and server routing
* **Free VPNs** may have data limits, logs, or ads
* **Not all websites allow VPN traffic** (e.g., Netflix or banks)
* **Doesn’t stop malware or phishing** (need antivirus + firewall)
* **Can’t prevent user-side tracking** (cookies, browser history)

---

### **8. How does a VPN affect network speed?**

VPN can **reduce internet speed** because:

* Traffic is **encrypted** (adds processing overhead)
* Data is routed through **remote servers** (adds latency)
* Free servers may be **overloaded**
